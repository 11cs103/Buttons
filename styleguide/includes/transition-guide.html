  <p>We've made some major improvements to the Buttons library. In order to integrate buttons into your current project you'll need to make the following changes:</p>

  <div class="docs-content">
    <ol class="docs-list">
        <li>Compass has been replaced with autoprefixer. Compass is not reccomended but it is still supported.</li>
        <li>Button colors are now complete independant (ex. button-primary) we no longer have classes liek <code>button-flat-primary</code> to achive this you now simly add <code>button-flat button-primary</code></li>
        <li>Buttons styles are now independant (ex. button-flat, button-3d, etc.). You can apply these styles and they will automatically pick up the color attached to the button (ex. button-primary button-3d)</li>
    </ol>

The tl;dr usage is:

```shell
pushd svg-builder && npm install && grunt && popd
```

Run this from the root of the Buttons project and what that will do is:

  * change in to svg-builder
  * install the npm dependencies
  * Run Grunt which will build out the inline SVGs
  * return you to the root Buttons directory
